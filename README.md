- Revalidation of 10 seconds set as placeholder for incremental static generation so that changes are fetched for user who has loaded meetups.

- Discussion on getServerSideProps() usage vs getStaticProps() usage in our application. GetStaticProps() remains in place with getServerSideProps() example in place.

- Implementation of static paths. Values for paths currently hardcoded as placeholders, array of potential endpoints to be created dynamically once backend is implemented with db.

- Begin api setup with post request.

- A new meetup can be created and is stored in MongoDB Atlas.

- All meetups on main page now fed from MongoDB backend. Updates appropriately if new meetup created.

- Details fed for each meet up from MongoDB backend.

- Added meta data in head for seo benefits.
